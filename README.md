# News App

Simple news app bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.io/) 
which eases up the setup of cross-cutting concerns like:

- Typescript setup
- Icons
- Resource loading (fonts)
- App icon
- Splashscreen
- Automatic release management

For a majority of big enterprise apps,
Expo becomes a burden because you want to have access to native projects 
in order to use 3-rd party native dependency and/or not rely on Expo's proprietary build system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js - refer to .nvmrc for a version of node this project is built with

## Local usage

- Run ios/android emulator
- Do ```yarn ios/android```
